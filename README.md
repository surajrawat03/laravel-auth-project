# Laravel User Role Authentication

In this project, I've implemented authentication based on user roles. This setup allows for different access levels based on the user's role.

## Features
- Role-based authentication
- User registration and login
- The database has been seeded with an example user:
- Default user
 Email: suraj@gmail.com
 Password: abcd,./0


## Requirements
- PHP >= 7.2
- Composer
- Laravel 7
- Bootstrap for authentication UI

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/surajrawat03/laravel-auth-project

2. cd laravel-auth-project

3. composer install

4. cp .env.example .env

5. php artisan key:generate

6. php artisan project:setup
